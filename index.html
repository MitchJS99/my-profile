				<h1>Hi! I'm Mitch and that's my first (but not last) website.</h1>

				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>I'm a second year Business Managment student at King's College London. I have always wanted to learn coding but there was never enogh time. Finally the pandemic allowed me to forget about anything else and focus on that. This is my first website so don't juge!</p>
				<p>Here is a website <strong>I think</strong> you should enjoy.</p>

				<h3>Sailing</h3>
				<p>My father has introducment to that sport when I was a child. I didn't like it at first but it gets more exicting with time. I've never tried to make it more than a hobby cause that would make it boring. Sailing once in the while is just perfect.</p>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h3>CS GO</h3>
				<p>Yes! That's the hobby I acquired quite recently. Due to the pandemic and plenty of free time I've come across this old school game that change my year. I am very competitive and thus this game is perfect for me. The link above is connected to this passion.</p>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h3>Exploring the world!</h3>
				<p>I love traveling and one of the reasons that is that I can learn new cultures. Just being in the other place doen't make a huge difference. Only when you embrace it by trying new things and learning some new aspects in life. Than, you are truly a citizen of the world.</p>
